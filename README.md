# MonopolyDB - Simulating Monopoly Game using Procedures, Triggers, and Views 
## Project Description:
Welcome to the MonopolyDB project, an exciting and educational endeavor that brings the classic Monopoly board game to life through the power of databases. As the author of this project, I am thrilled to present an in-depth exploration of how I leveraged stored procedures, triggers, and views to create a dynamic and interactive game simulation within a relational database environment.

## Key Highlights:
MonopolyDB showcases the seamless fusion of gaming and database technology, offering an immersive gaming experience while demonstrating my mastery of advanced SQL concepts. Here's what sets this project apart:

**Gameplay Rediscovered**: Through MonopolyDB, I've reimagined the familiar gameplay of Monopoly, translating it into a digital realm while preserving the essence of the original board game. Players can roll dice, navigate the game board, make property transactions, and accumulate wealth, all managed within the database.

**Database Design**: The foundation of MonopolyDB lies in its meticulously crafted database schema. Every element of the game, from players and properties to chance cards and dice rolls, is orchestrated through well-defined tables and relationships that ensure data accuracy and integrity.

**Stored Procedures**: One of the cornerstones of this project is the utilization of stored procedures. These meticulously designed procedures undertake various functionalities, such as determining rent based on property ownership, calculating player movements, and managing financial transactions, all while encapsulating complex logic.

**Triggers in Action**: MonopolyDB employs triggers to respond automatically to specific events, enhancing the game's responsiveness and realism. Triggers are seamlessly woven into the gameplay, updating player balances, enforcing property ownership rules, and automating various game actions behind the scenes.

**Insightful Views**: With carefully crafted views, players can gain unique insights into the game's progression. The "Gameplay Trail" view provides a snapshot of each turn, displaying player actions, property interactions, and current standings, offering an engaging visual representation of the game's evolution.

## Conclusion:
MonopolyDB stands as a testament to my creativity, technical prowess, and commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of databases and gaming. As you explore this project, you'll witness the harmonious fusion of classic gameplay with cutting-edge database technology. I invite you to dive into the world of MonopolyDB, explore its inner workings, and experience firsthand the excitement and innovation it brings to the realm of database-driven game development.
